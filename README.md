No More Cry" is an FPS RPG game created for Global Game Jam 2024. In "No More Cry," players experience the story of a young person living in the United States who, in need of money, is invited to a family's home to work as a babysitter. The player's goal is to reset the timer in the upper-left corner without making the baby cry. In addition to this primary objective, there are additional tasks for the player to complete in the refrigerator. When these three tasks and the condition of the baby not crying are met, the player wins the game at the end of the 5-minute countdown.
